# ChromeExtension_FlashcardBuilder
Highlight text within google chrome and press the shortcut to have the questions and answers populated.

## Motivation
My motivation was simple, I wanted to be able to make flashcards as quickly as possible from the web. Sure you learn a lot from writing, but I'm planning on reviewing extensively. 

## Features
React/Redux with Firebase backend.

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
Download the repo and apply it to the chrome developers extension.
